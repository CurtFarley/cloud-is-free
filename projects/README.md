# Projects

> Start a project at any time.

## Before we start

**You are fully responsible for any invoice on your AWS account.** This documentation is only intended to help you in the realization of practical projects. You are responsible for every action taken on your account.

Below is the list of projects realized with an optimized use of the Free Tier. Some projects use paid tools to be properly implemented. **It's up to you to decide whether or not to pay for the paid tools.** If you are able to pay, I strongly advise you to do so. But if you can't afford it, it is specified through the *Free-only route* field if the project is partially feasible using only the Free Tier.

Please take a close look at the Free Tier service:
- AWS : https://aws.amazon.com/fr/free/

These projects have been done beforehand to verify their cost. The budget specified for each project is the one found after one month of use. Billing is detailed in the last part of each project.

You will find a short list of information for each project:
- *Objective;*
- *Difficulty;*
- *Time to complete;*
- *Budget;*
- *Free-only route.*

All the information about the project is available on its page.
