- Execute email and SMS sendings from a website using S3, API Gateway and Lambda;
- Manage email and SMS sendings using Step Functions;
- Create and send an email with AWS using SES and Lambda;
- Create and send a SMS with AWS using SNS and Lambda;

Time to start the project, but before that, the best is to first learn how Lambda works.
